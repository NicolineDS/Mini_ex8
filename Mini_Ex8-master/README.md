# Mini_Ex8
Our program: https://rawgit.com/MathiasTvilling/Mini_Ex8/master/What_is_your_mood%3F/empty-example/index.html

This program is made by Nicoline Due Smedegaard, Cathrine Dybro and Mathias Tvilling. 
We have named the program "What is your mood?". It makes use of the Giphy search API, and essentially picks a GIF from 25 available and displays it. The keyword for the search is mood, and the query return 25 GIFs. 

This was not the program we intentionally wanted to make. Our original idea was to make a program, which would show the movement of the sun. But we had a lot of difficulties finding accessible API that would fit into our program. We therefore settled on making a mood generator that shows the users mood through gifâ€™s, and each time the user refresh the page the gif will change. 

It was really interesting to work with API and the process of searching for accessible was a great challenge. We came to the conclusion that we should not create the idea for the program first but instead see which types of API there were available, and from that create the concept for our program. This made the process a lot easier for our group. We spend a lot of time looking through different API's, and settled on Giphy because of it being very easy to use. Through searching different API's, we practiced reading the JSON they return, and this really helped the understanding when we got to coding.
